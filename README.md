## Custom Next.js project template

To use this template:

`npx create-next-app@latest --example https://github.com/luke-dcz/next.js-project-template <YOUR_APP_NAME>`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the home page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

TailwindCSS is used for styles - check out the [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

Add new pages in the app folder in their own folder with the page in a page.tsx file. You can also add a pages custom layout in a layout.tsx file.

Define any custom components in the components folder.

Define any constants, types and utils in the libs folder.

Add your own favicon inside the app folder.
